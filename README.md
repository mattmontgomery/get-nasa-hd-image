# get-nasa-hd-image

This is just a simple, largely unnecessary script I cobbled together to test out `await`/`async`.

I'm a little behind the curve, I guess.

Anyway, `npm run build` will build. You should (and I haven't tested this...) be able to use it basically like this:

```js
const { getHdUrl, getUrl } = require('get-nasa-hd-image');
```

or

```js
import { getHdUrl, getUrl } from 'get-nasa-hd-image';
```
